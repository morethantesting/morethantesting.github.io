Are you looking for fresh and high quality news on Software Testing?

Let's face it, most of us have no time to scan through the web looking for the latest news. Luckily, there are great people who do just that and publish completely for free!

Below you'll find top 5 software testing newsletters to follow in 2020.

## #1 [Software Testing Weekly](https://softwaretestingweekly.com/)
Published every: **Friday**

{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-software-testing-weekly.png" alt="Software Testing Weekly newsletter" href="https://softwaretestingweekly.com/" follow=true %}

Software Testing Weekly is a newsletter that includes only the best picks of software testing news. Each link is carefully selected and described with an insightful note, giving the reader an opportunity to easily decide on what to read. Topics covered in the newsletter vary across general testing news, test automation and testing tools. At the end of each issue, you can find a link to something funny - just right for starting the weekend!

So if you're looking for quality (over quantity) news that are hand-picked and delivered in a nice, personal way - you will find this one interesting.

## #2 {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" content="Testing Bits" %}
Published every: **Sunday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/SQAMATT" content="Matt Hutchison" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/testingcurator" content="@testingcurator" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-testing-bits.jpg" alt="Testing Bits newsletter" href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" %}

Testing Bits has been around for a few years already and Matt has proven to be very consistent with publishing. Weekly issues include pretty much all the links that can be found around the web on software testing, automation, conferences and podcasts. It's a great overview of all things going on in the testing world in one place.

However, it's just a list of links without any personal comment or brief description, so you need to trust your gut feeling and choose the link to read basing on the title only. Also there's no email subscription available, only the {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com/feed/" content="RSS feed" %} and social accounts.

## #3 {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" content="Ministry of Testing" %}
Published every: **Monday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com" content="Ministry of Testing" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/ministryoftest" content="@ministryoftest" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-ministry-of-testing.png" alt="Ministry of Testing newsletter" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" %}

Ministry of Testing is one of the biggest testing communities out there. Their main newsletter includes links to variety of topics, ranging from testing and automation to podcasts and events. They cover each link with a very brief description which is nice but not as comprehensive to always be sure about choosing a position to read.

Unfortunately, many of the links direct to their own website and require registration to access the content, causing rather restrictive experience.

## #4 {% include link.html href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" content="Methods & Tools" %}
Published every: **month**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.martinig.ch/index.php" content="Martinig & Associates" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/methodsandtools" content="@methodsandtools" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-methods-and-tools.png" alt="Methods & Tools newsletter" href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" %}

If you're too busy to digest newsletters weekly, then this might be a right choice for you. Methods & Tools has been publishing since 2000 (sic!) and it covers a monthly round up of selected testing news. Some of the links are described, making it easier for a reader to choose what to read.

If it comes to the design, well, the site may bring some nostalgia to those who remember old good PHP and the early days of the Internet!

## #5 {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" content="Five for Friday" %}
Published every: **Friday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/alanpage" content="Alan Page" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-five-for-friday.png" alt="Five for Friday newsletter" href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" %}

Five for Friday is a series of blog posts published weekly by Alan. His concise round up covers five interesting, and often surprising, links that are not only related to software testing, but also to general software development, leadership and other things. You can always find something unusual there.

However, no email subscription is available. You can only subscribe to the {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/rss" content="RSS" %} feed.
