Are you looking for fresh and high-quality news on Software Testing?

Let's face it, most of us don't have time to scan through the web looking for the latest updates. Luckily, some great people do just that and publish completely for free!

Below you'll find top 5 Software Testing newsletters to follow in 2020.

## #1 [Software Testing Weekly](https://softwaretestingweekly.com/)
Published every: **Friday**

Software Testing Weekly is the newest one out there, launched at the beginning of 2020. In each issue, you can find only the best 10â€“15 picks of software testing news. Every link is carefully selected and described with an insightful note, allowing you to easily decide on what to read. The newsletter includes a healthy mix of articles on testing, test automation and testing tools. And it's published on Friday --- the earliest of all the other newsletters.

So if you want to be the first one to hear the quality (over quantity) news that are hand-picked and delivered in a nice, personal way --- this is the right choice for you.

## #2 {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" content="Testing Bits" %}
Published every: **Sunday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/SQAMATT" content="Matt Hutchison" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/testingcurator" content="@testingcurator" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-testing-bits.jpg" alt="Testing Bits" href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" %}

Testing Bits has been around for a few years already. Every issue includes tens of links to updates on software testing, automation, conferences and podcasts. It's a great overview of all things going on in the testing world in one place. However, the links come as they are, without any description, so you need to choose a link basing on the title only. Unfortunately, there's no email subscription available. You can only follow the {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com/feed/" content="RSS" %} feed and social accounts.

So if you're looking for a huge quantity of plain links to browse through and you don't mind lack of description, you will like this one.

## #3 {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" content="Ministry of Testing" %}
Published every: **Monday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com" content="Ministry of Testing" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/ministryoftest" content="@ministryoftest" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-ministry-of-testing.png" alt="Ministry of Testing" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" %}

Ministry of Testing is one of the biggest online testing communities. Their main newsletter includes lots of links to various resources, ranging from testing and automation to podcasts and events. Many links are briefly described which helps to choose the right one. The issues tend to be quite long, but everyone will find something to check out there. Unfortunately, some links direct to paid content, causing rather a restrictive experience.

So if you don't mind paid content and waiting until Monday to hear the previous week's news, you may find this one interesting.

## #4 {% include link.html href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" content="Methods & Tools" %}
Published every: **month**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.martinig.ch/index.php" content="Martinig & Associates" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/methodsandtools" content="@methodsandtools" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-methods-and-tools.png" alt="Methods & Tools" href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" %}

Methods & Tools has been publishing since 2000 (sic!) and it covers a monthly round-up of selected testing news. Some of the links are described, making it easier for a reader to choose what to read. If it comes to the design, well, the site may bring some nostalgia to those who remember the early days of the Internet when PHP was the king. ðŸ˜Š

So if you're too busy to digest newsletters weekly, you probably want to follow this one.

## #5 {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" content="Five for Friday" %}
Published every: **Friday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/alanpage" content="Alan Page" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/alanpage" content="@alanpage" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-five-for-friday.png" alt="Five for Friday" href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" %}

Five for Friday is a series of blog posts published weekly by Alan. His concise round-up covers five interesting --- and often surprising --- links that are not only related to software testing but also general software development, leadership and other things. Everything is neatly described and you can always find something unusual there. Sadly, no email subscription is available, but there's an {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/rss" content="RSS" %} feed.

So if you want a quick, digestible read --- check out this one.
