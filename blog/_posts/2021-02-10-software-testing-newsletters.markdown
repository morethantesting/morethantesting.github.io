Software Testing Weekly is a newsletter focused on selecting the best 15â€“20 news every week. Every link is carefully selected and described with an insightful note, allowing you to easily decide on what to read. The newsletter includes a healthy mix of articles on testing, test automation, testing tools and more. And it's published every Friday --- the earliest of all the other newsletters.

So if you want to be the first one to read the best, hand-picked news delivered in a nice, personal way --- this is the right choice for you.

## {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" content="Testing Bits" %}
Published every: **Sunday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/SQAMATT" content="Matt Hutchison" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/testingcurator" content="@testingcurator" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-testing-bits.jpg" alt="Testing Bits" href="http://blog.testingcurator.com" %}

Testing Bits has been around for a few years already. Every issue includes tens of links to news about testing, automation, conferences and podcasts. It's a great overview of all things going on in the testing world in one place. However, the links come as they are, without any description, so you need to choose one basing on the title only. Unfortunately, there's no email subscription available. You can only follow the {% include link.html href="http://blog.testingcurator.com/feed/" content="RSS" %} feed and social accounts.

So if you're looking for a huge quantity of links to browse through and you don't mind lack of description, you will like this one.

## {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" content="Ministry of Testing" %}
Published every: **Monday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com" content="Ministry of Testing" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/ministryoftest" content="@ministryoftest" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-ministry-of-testing.png" alt="Ministry of Testing" href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/ministry-of-testing-newsletters" %}

Ministry of Testing is one of the biggest online testing communities. Their newsletter includes links ranging from testing and automation to podcasts and events. They're briefly described which helps to choose the right one to read. The issues tend to be quite long, but thanks to this everyone will find something useful there. Unfortunately, most of the content comes from the community itself and some lead to paid content, causing rather a restrictive experience at times.

So if you're looking for a mix of community-based links, you don't mind paid content and waiting until Monday, you may find this one interesting.

## {% include link.html href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" content="Methods & Tools" %}
Published every: **month**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://www.martinig.ch/index.php" content="Martinig & Associates" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/methodsandtools" content="@methodsandtools" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-methods-and-tools.png" alt="Methods & Tools" href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/facts/facts.php" %}

Methods & Tools has been publishing since 2000 and it covers a monthly round-up of selected testing news. Some of the links are described, making it easier for a reader to choose what to read. And if it comes to the design, the site may bring some nostalgia to those who remember the early days of the Internet when PHP was still the king.

So if you're too busy to digest news weekly, you probably want to follow this one.

## {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" content="Five for Friday" %}
Published every: **Friday**  
Curated by: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/alanpage" content="Alan Page" %}<br>Twitter: {% include link.html href="https://twitter.com/alanpage" content="@alanpage" %}
{% include image.html src="/blog/assets/newsletter-five-for-friday.png" alt="Five for Friday" href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/" %}

Five for Friday is a series of blog posts published weekly by Alan. His concise round-up covers five interesting --- and often surprising --- links that are not only related to software testing but also general software development, leadership and other things. Everything is neatly described and you can always find something unusual there. Sadly, no email subscription is available, but there's an {% include link.html href="https://angryweasel.com/blog/rss" content="RSS" %} feed.

So if you want a quick, digestible read --- check out this one.
